  "prompt": "A lone beautiful red-headed cyborg woman stands in the ash-choked ruins of a fallen war machine yard \u2014 not gleaming with neon, but caked in soot, rust, and dried coolant. Her body is a patchwork of industrial-grade cybernetics: exposed hydraulic limbs, welded plating over scarred flesh, cables snaking from her spine into a cracked power core on her back that hums with unstable, dim amber light. Her face is lovely, but weathered, glistening with unshed tears, stares out over the battlefield with quiet, crushing grief. \n\nShe holds a heavy, jury-rigged blaster \u2014 not sleek or futuristic, but cobbled together from salvaged military parts, its barrel warped from overheating, its grip wrapped in frayed cloth and duct tape. Her fingers, half-mechanical, tremble slightly around the trigger, not from fear \u2014 but from the weight of what she\u2019s seen. \n\nAround her: the carcasses of fallen mechs, their armor pitted and scorched, limbs bent like broken arms reaching for the sky. Smoke rises not in elegant plumes, but in thick, greasy clouds from smoldering fuel tanks and crushed supply convoys. Broken comms arrays spew static. Abandoned helmets, half-melted infant cribs from a ruined refugee shelter, and a single child\u2019s shoe caught in the wreckage \u2014 all scattered like forgotten prayers. \n\nShe is not here to conquer. Not to celebrate. She is here because she was there when it happened. She remembers the laughter. The names. The faces that turned to ash. And though her body is half-machine, her heart \u2014 real, raw, aching \u2014 still beats. She does not weep aloud. She does not scream. But her posture speaks volumes: shoulders slumped under the burden, yet spine straight. Head high. Her gaze is not angry \u2014 it\u2019s sorrowful. Determined. Not to fight another war\u2026 but to make sure  this one is the last. ",
