## Use Flash Attention to save memory and improve speed.

Enabling flash attention for the diffusion model reduces memory usage by varying amounts of MB.
eg.:
 - flux 768x768 ~600mb
 - SD2 768x768 ~1400mb

For most backends, it slows things down, but for cuda it generally speeds it up too.
At the moment, it is only supported for some models and some backends (like cpu, cuda/rocm, metal).

Run by adding `--diffusion-fa` to the arguments and watch for:
```
[INFO ] stable-diffusion.cpp:312  - Using flash attention in the diffusion model
```
and the compute buffer shrink in the debug log:
```
[DEBUG] ggml_extend.hpp:1004 - flux compute buffer size: 650.00 MB(VRAM)
```

## Offload weights to the CPU to save VRAM without reducing generation speed.

Using `--offload-to-cpu` allows you to offload weights to the CPU, saving VRAM without reducing generation speed.

## Use params backend to reduce VRAM or RAM usage.

`--params-backend` controls where model parameters are kept. If it is not set, parameters use the same backend as `--backend`, so a GPU runtime backend also keeps parameters in VRAM.

Use CPU params to reduce VRAM usage:

```shell
--backend cuda0 --params-backend cpu
```

This keeps model weights in system RAM and moves them to the runtime backend when needed. `--offload-to-cpu` is a compatibility shortcut that prepends `*=cpu` to `--params-backend`, so explicit module assignments can still override it:

```shell
--offload-to-cpu --params-backend te=disk
```

Use disk params to reduce both VRAM and RAM usage:

```shell
--backend cuda0 --params-backend disk
```

This reloads parameters from the model file on demand and releases them after use. It has the lowest memory residency, but can be slower because weights must be read again. `disk` is never selected implicitly; set it explicitly when RAM usage matters more than reload cost.

Per-module assignments can target only the largest modules:

```shell
--backend cuda0 --params-backend diffusion=disk,te=cpu,vae=cpu
```

See [backend selection](./backend.md) for full syntax.

## Use quantization to reduce memory usage.
